The command to attach a file can be placed anywhere between $mail = new PHPMailer(); and !$mail->Send(); and it's called AddAttachment($path);. This single line will add the attachment to your mail.

$path is the path of the filename. It can be a relative one (from your script, not the PHPMailer class) or a full path to the file you want to attach.

If you want more options or you want to specify encoding and the MIME type of the file, then you can use three more parameters, all of which are optional:
AddAttachment($path,$name,$encoding,$type);

$name is an optional parameter, used to set the name of the file that will be embedded within the e-mail. The person who will recieve your mail will then only see this name, rather than the original filename.

$encoding is a little more technical, but with this parameter you can set the type of encoding of the attachment. The default is base64. Other types that are supported include: 7bit, 8bit, binary & quoted-printable. Please refer to your SMTP documentation about encoding and the differences between types. In general, mail servers will convert encodings they don't want to handle into their preferred encoding type.

$type is the MIME type of the attached file. Content types are defined not necessarily by file suffixes (i.e., .GIF or .MP3), but, rather, a MIME type (MIME = Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is used. This parameter makes it possible change the MIME type of an attachment from the default value of application/octet-stream (which works with every kind of file) to a more specific MIME type, such as image/jpeg for a .JPG photo, for instance.
